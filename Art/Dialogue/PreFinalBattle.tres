*Silas sees Daniel, and the Prince of Gloomwood with his knights*
Silas: “STOPPPPPP!!”
???: “Hmmm?”
Silas: “I said stop at once!”
???: “You dare talk to me, The Prince of Gloomwood, Malcolm the Great, in such a manner??”
Silas: “Get off your high horse Malcolm, I can see my prince tied up right behind you.”  
Daniel: *muffled* “Heyyyyy.”
Silas: “Now are you gonna let him go the easy way or the hard way?”
Malcolm: “No way you are getting him back! After what he tried to do!”
Silas: “What are you talking about?”
Malcolm: “I won’t let you manipulate me with your poison tongue. You either leave or meet the same fate as him!”
*Silas chokes up on his weapon*
Silas: “I’ll free you in just a second my Prince”
