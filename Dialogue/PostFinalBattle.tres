*Malcolm on the ground*
Malcolm:”Can’t believe you’ll take my life, then you’ll take my sister! Does your cruelty know no bounds?!”
Silas: “I was not about to do either of those things.”
Malcolm: “Huh?”
*Silas moves toward Daniel, ungags him and begins unties him*
Daniel:”Why would I take your sister?”
Malcolm: “Why else would you, she’s the cutest little princess anywhere. Who wouldn’t wanna marry her?”
*Silas and Daniel shocked sprite*
Silas and Daniel: “MARRIAGE?!?!?!”
???: “That’s quite enough”
Malcolm: “Maisie??”
*Maisie walks in*
Maisie: “I’m very sorry if my brother has caused you any trouble Prince Daniel.”
Daniel: “Uhhh…thanks, I’m fine now. What’s going on here?”
Maisie: “The head knight just informed me that a group of knights were taken away by my brother for my sake.”
*Malcolm anguish face*
Malcolm: “I told him not to say anything!”
Maisie: “Well I’m glad he did because you could’ve really hurt someone!”
Malcolm: “But what about your marriage to him?”
Maisie:”I wasn’t gonna marry him buffoon!! Father and mother only suggested it.”
Malcolm: “Oh.., I just assumed. I was just looking out for you.”
Maisie: “I know you were, but you have to be more informed before you capture another kingdom's prince. Understood?”
Malcolm: “Yes Maisie.”
Maisie: “Alright, go wash up, Mother and Father want to see you.”
Malcolm: “Not again…”
*Malcolm grumbles as he heads inside the castle*
Maisie: “Again, I’m very sorry for any trouble my brother has caused.”
Daniel: “It’s okay, no harm done.”
*Silas pouting*
Silas: “That’s absolutely not true.”
Daniel: “… well, either way, you didn’t do anything wrong, so you don’t need to apologize!”
Silas: “That’s correct, we’ll get an apology out of your brother later.”
Daniel: “You handled the situation wonderfully, by the way!”
Daniel: “Anyone would think you were the oldest!”
Maisie:” …”
Maisie: “…thank you…”
*Maisie runs off in the same direction as her brother*
*Silas, Daniel and the Gloomwood knights stare at each other in silence*
Knights: “…”
Daniel: “… um”
Silas: “Hey, morons, this is the part where you escort Maisie and Malcolm back home safely.”
Knights: ” …”
Knights: “OH, YES, RIGHT! MEN, LET’S MOVE.”
<the knights leave in a hurry>
*Silas sighs*
Silas: “I don’t usually wish job insecurity on anyone but oh my lord”
Daniel: “Those knights seem like the type to need protecting, not Malcolm and Maisie.”
Silas: “Right, those bumbling blue buffoons can barely be called knights”
Silas: “I’d consider them to be more luggage than knight”
Daniel: “That’s too meeean.”
*Daniel and Silas laugh*
Daniel: “Well, that was … fun, wasn’t it?”
Silas: “....”
Daniel: “Something wrong?” 
Silas: “My Daniel, Daniel, love, salt of the earth, as much as I am incapable of showing it, I was extremely worried.”
Daniel: “You were?”
Silas: “Yes, I was.”
Silas: “Despite how incompentant those knights are in general, it still was a terrifying sight to see you being taken by them.”
Silas: “I was barely holding myself together, I was…I-”
Daniel: “I-uhh…” 
Daniel: “I’m sorry for my crude and joking remarks, that was insensitive of me.”
Silas: “No-stop, you don’t have to apologize, it’s not-”
[Daniel hugs Silas]
Daniel: “It’s alright, I’m alright, okay?”
[Silas hugs Daniel back]
[After a moment, the both of them pull away]
Silas: “In the future, don’t go running off without me”
Daniel: “Oh course, I can’t imagine a future adventure with you not by my side”
Silas: “God, you-”
Daniel: “And the next time I get kidnapped, I’ll make sure to drag you with me!”
*Silas pouts*
Silas: “Don’t even suggest that, you’re on your own the next time.”
Daniel: *laughs*
*Silas sighs*
Silas: “I’m going to have to report everything that happened today to your mother, what a pain.”
Daniel: “Are you really thinking about work right now?”
Silas: “Of course! There’s the lacking security in the garden, new relations with Gloomwood, this kidnapping event as a whole-”
Daniel: “Come on now, there will be time later to think about those things. There is something more important right now to worry about.”
Silas: “Like what?”
Daniel: “You’ve saved your sweet dashing Daniel from being kidnapped, the air is peaceful and there’s a nice, beautiful, frankly ~romantic~ sunset right now.”
Silas: “…”
Silas: “I’m taking away all those books, you maniac”
Daniel: “Hmm, is that a no?”
Silas: “That’s not what I said, was it?”
Daniel: “You’re right, as you always are.”
